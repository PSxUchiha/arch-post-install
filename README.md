This is basically for getting set up with a GUI after you are booted up with the arch install in a tty. I only mostly prefer gnome and kde so these two are the ones that I wrote scripts for. I know it seems like a drag to write scripts for simple tasks but I'm lazy so nvm. 

I also added the script for installing "yay" an open-source AUR helper from this repo: https://github.com/Jguer/yay

An AUR helper can make life a lot easier and I think I prefer it over pamac because I really think I can be much more focused and effective while doing stuff from the terminal. If you still want pamac set up then just use yay to get it from AUR and there you go. Enable AUR support from preferences and it's done. 
# arch-post-install
